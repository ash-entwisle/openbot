# openbot

I got bored over the summer, so I decided to learn typescript by making a discord bot. 

## Features

So far, the bot has limited functionality. However, 
I plan to add more features in the future when I have time. 
Currently, the bot can:

- get a users avatar
- get the latency of the bot
- get the uptime of the bot

### Roadmap

So far, I have nothing planned, but I will add more features as I think of them. 
If you have any ideas, feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.

## Usage

I am not currently hosting the bot, but if I do, I will add a link to invite the bot to your server. 
If you want to host it yourself, follow the steps below. 
To host it yourself, you should have the latest version of bun and docker installed.
